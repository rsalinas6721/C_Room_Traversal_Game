# C_Room_Traversal_Game
Room Traversal Game
salinari.buildrooms.c should be compiled and executed. This program will create seven random rooms from a list of ten possibilities. These rooms will then be initialized as files to be used by the salinari.adventure.c program. Once the adventure program is executed the adventure game begins by retrieving the files previously created. This game allows a user to traverse through a list of rooms until the final room or "END ROOM" is found.
